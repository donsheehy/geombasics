# geombasics
## A Python package for constructing and viewing basic geometry

The heart of this project has two main pieces.
The first piece is a library to represent and compute with geometric primitives such as vectors, points, lines, circles, and polygons.
The second piece is a set of tools to facilitate drawing these primitives.
Currently, all drawing is assumed to be done by outputting svg (as a string) and using the convention that stylistic aspects of the drawing will be managed in css.
